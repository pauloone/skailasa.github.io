        - Succint overview of what it takes to launch a succesful IT business.
        Meanders into futurism towards the end, and speculation about the
        kind of personality it takes to run a business. 3/5.

        - Story, written like a novel, of Theranos, and how far bullshit
        could take you in Silicon Valley at it's height. Really interesting,
        even if a little sensationalist. 4/5.
