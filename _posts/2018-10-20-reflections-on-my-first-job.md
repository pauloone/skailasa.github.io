title: "Reflections on a year in Startups"

Since graduating last year I've been living a millenial aspiration, working in startups
and living in a 5-person house share in North London...

Having recently left my last job to begin an MSc I thought it would be a good time to
reflect on beginning my career in startups, and what, if any, insights I could distil
from it.

Fuck it, let's do a top 5.

### 1) It's challenging, all the time, and for different reasons
Startups, especially the good ones, will try their best to promote learning and teaching.
This is especially the case if they've hired a lot of junior staff, but to be honest
there's simply not enough time. Shit has to get done, there isn't enough time to really
figure out how - at least not at the start.

If you've gone there to learn, you're in for a hell of a curve. I felt like I was learning
how to ship and deploy a product, at the same time as still figuring out how to write half
decent code.

### 2) You'll become good buddies with your colleagues
I've spent countless hours at my desk next to the same 2-3 people. The proximity, and often
the stress, will basically forge you and your colleagues together. Sounds like a cliche one, 
but to be fair, so is (1), but it's true. Prepare to make some friends.

### 3) You need to figure out your motivation
No-one is there to motivate you, you have to figure out what you are going for and really go
for it. If you want to take charge of something, and push something into production, it
can happen. 

### 4) You need to know when to move on
If you're not learning, your're not moving forward. Just like in coding, if you're not failing
fast you're not growing fast enough.

### 5) Everyone is figuring something out for the first time
This was a strange realisation to have. 

Overall, I'm glad I've had the experience, but I'm not sure if I would do it again. I can't
deny it was exciting when things are moving fast and you're developing, learning and deploying
something you've worked on from scratch. You get a taste for what it's like to really build
something. However, especially if you're young, you might want to try it but also move to a
bigger company or even back to Uni at some point. I think you need some experience doing things
in an environment where there is more of an opportunity to find a sage like mentor, someone who's
seen it all before. This probably isn't going to happen in a small agile business, scrapping
against big incumbents and against the competition.

For people from non-traditional/non-CS backgrounds though startups are the place to cut your
teeth. I came into tech from a very traditional Physics degree, where the most computing I
did involved a couple of badly written Python functions which still disgrace my GitHub. On that
note I basically understood Git to be a big old save button on my work, and had no idea why you'd
ever want to write a commit message. I landed on my arse in my first job, and figuring everything
out for the first time was intense - but it also showed me that I really wanted to learn about
computing. I was excited to learn, and I certainly hadn't felt like that for large parts of my
degree. This is a point I wanted to emphasise with (4), if you're not growing and learning you
should think about your position.

### Bonus) Is this a bubble??
Having spent the year attending meetups, talking to other devs, browsing HN, and watching
the seemingly endless stream of new Data/ML startups set to "disrupt" everything from banking
to my lunch it's starting to feel like a false economy. Few companies are turning a profit,
many are riding off dubios venture backed proposals. In terms of the future, who's to say,
all I know is that it will somehow involve blockchain...
