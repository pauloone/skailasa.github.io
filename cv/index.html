<h1>CV</h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

By day I'm an Engineer at an <a href="www.cytora.com">ML startup</a> in London, 
by night and also some days I'm a Computational Scientist studying for
my Master's at <a href="www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>. My undergrad
was in Physics, no I don't really know why either.

I'm interested in all things mathematical, and computational, and at any
one time have a number of half finished projects on the go. At the moment
I am attempting to <a href="https://github.com/skailasa/monkey">write an interpreter in Golang</a>,
build a <a href="https://github.com/skailasa/pejnet">Peep Show chatbot</a>, and for
some reason learn Haskell.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3> Cytora, London, September 2017-Present </h3>
I joined a Cytora pre-series A. I've worked on a variety of projects, but
these have all had something to do with processing large-ish datasets quickly/well.
Stack: Python, GCP, ElasticSearch, Postgres (Docker, K8s)

<h3> Cambridge Quantum Computing, June-September 2017 </h<>
I was an intern at another startup, but this time it was a bit more scientific.
I was simulating potential architectures for quantum compilers.

<h3> the Humboldt University of Berlin June-September 2016 </h3>
I was an intern here too, in Computational Neuroscience. I was writing simulations
in Python, and in general struggling to keep up with a lot of biology.

<h2> Education </h2>
<h3> University College London, 2018-2020 </h3>
I will be at UCL for the foreseeable future studying for a MSc in Scientific Computing.
I am still working part-time, and am in general fairly knackered.

<h3> Durham University 2013-2017</h3>
I completed an integrated Bachelors/Masters in Physics at Durham. I spent a lot of time
struggling to understand and spell "Brillouin Zones", and a lot more time adjusting the
blistering cold of the North East of England.
