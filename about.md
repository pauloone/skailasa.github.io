# About

By day I'm a Software Engineer at an [ML startup](https://cytora.com) in London, 
by night and also some days I'm a Computational Scientist studying for
my Master's at University College London. My undergrad was in Physics, 
no I don't really know why either.

I'm interested in all things mathematical, and computational, and at any
one time have a number of half finished projects on the go. At the moment
I am attempting to [write an interpreter in Golang](https://github.com/skailasa/monkey),
build a [Peep Show chatbot](https://github.com/skailasa/pejnet), and for
some reason learn Haskell.

Outside of work, I also like long walks and browsing wikipedia for hours on end.
