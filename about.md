# About

I'm currently a Master's student at UCL, studying Computational Science, foolishly
aiming to a PhD in the near future. Since finishing undergrad I've been working in
various startups in and around London.

I'm interested in all things mathematical, and computational, and at any
one time have a number of half finished projects on the go. At the moment
I am attempting to [write an interpreter in Golang](https://github.com/skailasa/monkey),
build a [Peep Show chatbot](https://github.com/skailasa/pejnet), and for
some reason learn Haskell.

Outside of work I'm a fan of solitary excercise, running, gymming etc, and going to
gigs when I can, and generally just chillin'.
