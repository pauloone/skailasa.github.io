# CV

## Experience
### Cytora, 2017-2018
I joined a Cytora pre-series A. I've worked on a variety of projects, but
these have all had something to do with processing large-ish datasets quickly/well.
Stack: Python, GCP, ElasticSearch, Postgres (Docker, K8s)

### Cambridge Quantum Computing, Summer 2017
I was an intern at another startup, but this time it was a bit more scientific.
I was simulating potential architectures for quantum compilers.

### the Humboldt University of Berlin, Summer 2016
I was an intern here too, in Computational Neuroscience. I was writing simulations
in Python, and in general struggling to keep up with a lot of biology.

## Education
### University College London, 2018-2020
I will be at UCL for the foreseeable future studying for a MSc in Scientific Computing.

### Durham University, 2013-2017
I completed an integrated Bachelors/Masters in Physics at Durham. I spent a lot of time
struggling to understand and spell "Brillouin Zones", and a lot more time adjusting to the
blistering cold of the North East of England.
